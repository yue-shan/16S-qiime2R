The following four input is required:
1. A table file,in either .qza . This should be the table.qza from dada2 analysis. prior to that I use qiime2 to analyze the fastq data. Note that the table could be already rarefied in qiime2 or not rarefied. Qiime2 and R can both rarefy it. 
2. A metadata file, in .tsv or .txt. 
3. A Taxonomy.qza file, this could be downloaded from qiime2 website
4. A rooted-tree.qza file.
