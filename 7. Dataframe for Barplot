pd_rarefy <- psmelt(phylo_rarefy_top50_ratio)
#psmelt will melt a phyloseq object into a dataframe. 
# phylo_rarefy_top50_ratio is similar to phylo, except it only has the higher abundant OTU and that the abundance is in percentage. 
head(pd_rarefy)
write.csv(pd_rarefy,"pd_rarefy.csv")
#pd_rarefy have all information needed in one data frame. It's similar to the frequency table from qiime2 but layed out in a R friendly way. 
#pd_rarefy is a dataframe, which is more useful for general statistic tests that phyloseq object can't do.
