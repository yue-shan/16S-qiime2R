### PCoA and other ordination 

Assuming we have N factors that contribute to the difference of the data set,e.g. age, height,body weight etc. There factors are not all independent. The goal of ordination is to create a set of independent variables n such that n << N. 

Ordination serves two purpose, statistical difference and data decompression. 

A thorough ordination is SVD, Singular Value Decomposition. For any matrix X, there is X= U*D*V<sup>T<sup>. U and V are the left and right singular matrix (orthogonal) and D is called singular values (diagonal). In R, svd is a function that returns three matrices. For example: 
```
svd1<- svd(scale(dataMatrix)
plot(svd1$V)
PCA is an ordination that's normalized the original data by subtracting values by the mean of each column and devide by standard deviation. It equals to the right singular matrix in svd

## PCoA 
PCoA stands for principle coordinate analysis. To create PCoA matrix, use the *ordinate* function.  
```
phylo_rarefy_unifrac_W <- ordinate(phylo, method="PCoA", 
                                  distance="unifrac", weighted=TRUE)
```

- The default method of ordination is "DCA", where it also supports "CCA", "RDA", "CAP", "DPCoA", "NMDS", "MDS", "PCoA").
- The default distance is "bray", where you can do "unifrac", "dist" etc. Bray-Curtis dissimilarity creates a matrix in function of the how much the samples are different. Whereas the UniFrac measures the phylogenetic distance between sets of taxa in a phylogenetic tree as the fraction of the branch length of the tree that leads to descendants from either one environment.
- "weighted= TRUE" means it considers the difference in abundance. unweighted is more useful in calling out rare species. For unifrac, the default is unweighted, which won't account for the abundance and is more useful to detect rare species.
-The distance is purely based on the tree, not taxonomy or sample data. 

To plot the graph, use *plot_ordination*:
```
PCoA_unifrac_W <-
  plot_ordination(phylo, phylo_rarefy_unifrac_W,
                  color =  "Treatment",shape = "Source", axes=1:2) + #there are 3 axes but we only make 2D graphs. axes=2:3 will make the other side. 
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 1) + 
  ggtitle("fecal") +
  scale_colour_viridis_d(begin = 0,end = 0.8,option = "plasma")+ #scale_colour_vividis_d() range from 0 to 1. 
  theme_q2r() +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank(),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.ticks = element_blank()) 
print(PCoA_unifrac_W)
```
Note: when I run the above, an error occured and told me that "source" is numaric. I need to change it to factor: 
```
sample_data(phylo)$Source <- as.factor(sample_data(phylo)$Source)
```

Finally, to also create individual graphs, use *facet_wrap*:
```
PCoA_unifrac_W_wrap <- PCoA_unifrac_W + facet_wrap(~Source)
+stat_ellipse() # draw a circle for each cluster
require(gridExtra)
grid.arrange(PCoA_unifrac_W,  PCoA_unifrac_W_wrap, nrow=2) #Side by side graph
```
## NMDS 
NMDS stands for Non-metric multidimensional scaling. NMDS use Bray (ecological difference) and is more useful for presence/absence of new species, whereas PCoA use unifracture which considers the phylogenetic difference. For my purpose PCoA is more appropriate. 
```
phylo_rarefy_nmds <- ordinate(phylo, method="NMDS", distance="bray")

PCoA_nmds<-
     plot_ordination(phylo, phylo_rarefy_nmds,
                     color =  "Treatment", shape= "Source",) +
     geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 1) + 
     scale_colour_viridis_d(begin = 0,end = 0.8,option = "plasma")+
     theme_q2r() +
     theme(legend.title = element_blank(),
           legend.text = element_text(size = 12),
           axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
           axis.ticks = element_blank()) 
PCoA_nmds+facet_wrap(~Source)+stat_ellipse()
PCoA_nmds_wrap <-PCoA_nmds+facet_wrap(~Source)+stat_ellipse()
grid.arrange(PCoA_nmds,PCoA_nmds_wrap,nrow=2) 
```
