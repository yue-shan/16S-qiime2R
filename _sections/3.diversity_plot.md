## Alpha-Diversity


The difference in the measurement methods: 

"Diversity indices applied to microbiota data consist of differing weights of two components, richness and evenness. Richness is a count of the number of different taxa observed in the community without regard to their frequencies, and evenness refers to the equitability of the taxa frequencies in a community. 
Three commonly used alpha diversity measures include species observed, Shannon index and Simpson index:
           S(obs)= ∑kI(pk>0)
           Shannon = −∑kpk ln(pk)
           Simpson=∑kp2k,
where p is some function of frequency, often relative abundance (proportion of total sequences) for each taxon, k.

Species observed is equal to richness and therefore provides no weight to the evenness component, Shannon index equally weights richness and evenness and Simpson index provides more weight to evenness." [Ref](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29872428/) 


Use *plot_richness* to make diversity plot:
```
 
  theme_diversityplot <- 
  theme(axis.title.y = element_text(size=8,color="Black"),
      axis.title.x = element_blank(),
      axis.text.y = element_text(size=8,color="Black"),
      axis.text.x = element_text(size=8,color="Black"),
      legend.title = element_blank(),
      legend.text = element_text(size = 8),
      legend.key.size = unit(0.5, "cm"),legend.key.height = unit(0.5, "cm"),
      legend.position="right",
      
      panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
      panel.grid.major = element_line(linetype = "solid",size=0.2,colour = "grey"),
      panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white", colour = "black", size=1.2),
      )
      
  phylo_alpha <- plot_richness(phylo, x = "Treatment",color = "Treatment",
                       measures=c("Observed","Shannon","Simpson"), nrow=1) +
                       theme_diversityplot

 phylo_alpha$layers
 phylo_alpha$layers<- phylo_alpha$layers[-1]
 phylo_alpha$layers
 #The phylo_alpha has built in geom_point which won't take the argument of "group". We can remove the geom_point and then  
 phylo_alpha +
  geom_point(aes(group = Treatment),position=position_jitterdodge(),alpha=0.5)+
   stat_summary(aes(group = Treatment), geom="point", fun=mean, size= 6,shape=15, position= position_dodge(width=0.9))+
   stat_summary(aes(group = Treatment), geom="errorbar", fun.data=mean_se, fun.args=list(mult=1), color="black", position="dodge")
