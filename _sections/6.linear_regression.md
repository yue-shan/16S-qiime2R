## transform the family table for linear regression of the abundance of different family
We split the dataframe by Family to create a list of dataframes, each have one family. We then merge all the small dataframes by column binding. The result is a dataframe with much less row and much more column, i.e. the number of row is equal to the number of samples we have. We also need to rename the Abundance column for each small dataframe so we can call out later the Abundance of interest. 

```
list1 <- split(pd_agg_family, pd_agg_family$Family, drop=F)


rename_Abundance1<-function (df) {
colnames(df)[colnames(df)=="Abundance"] <- paste("Abundance_", df$Family[1])
colnames(df)[colnames(df)=="Phylum"] <- paste("Phylum_", df$Family[1])
colnames(df)[colnames(df)=="Class"] <- paste("Class_", df$Family[1])
colnames(df)[colnames(df)=="Order"] <- paste("Order_", df$Family[1])
df <- subset(df, select= - c(OTU, Genus, Species, Kingdom))
return(df)
}

#Or below 
#rename_Abundance1<-function (df) {
#colnames(df)[3] <- paste("Abundance_", df$Family[1])
#}

for (i in 1:length(list1)) {
list1[[i]] <- rename_Abundance1(list1[[i]])
} # list1 has a list of list of dataframes. list1[i]is a list with one element, list1[[i]] is a dataframe.

for (i in 1:length(list1)) {
list1[[i]] <- subset (list1[[i]], select = -c(Family))
} #optional, remove the column. 

all_abundance <- list1[[1]] 
all_abundance <- merge(all_abundance, list1[[2]], 
by= c("Sample","EarTag","Group","Source","Treatment","Genotype","TreatmentWeek","WeekTreatment","Individual"))

for (i in 2:length(list1)) 
{all_abundance <- merge(all_abundance, list1[[i]], 
by= c("Sample","EarTag","Group","Source","Treatment","Genotype","TreatmentWeek","WeekTreatment","Individual"))
}
str(all_abundance) 

names(all_abundance) <- gsub(" ", "", names(all_abundance))#Remove space in column names
names(all_abundance) <- gsub("-", "_", names(all_abundance))#Change - to _ in column names.

write.csv(all_abundance, "all_abundance.csv")
```

## Add Lcn2 data to 16S data
I want to study the correlations between Lcn2 concentration and abundance. First, add a column with Lcn2 concentration to the dataframe: 

```  
lcn2 <- read.table(file="Lcn2bySampleID.txt")
lcn2 <- lcn2 %>% rename(Sample = SampleID) #rename the column SampleID to Sample 
family_lcn2 <- merge(all_abundance, lcn2, by.x= "Sample", all.x=TRUE)
ggplot(family_lcn2, aes(x=Lcn2_ug_per_mg_feces, y=Abundance_Bacteroidaceae,color=Treatment))+ geom_point()+geom_smooth(method = "lm")
ggplot(family_lcn2, aes(x=Lcn2_ug_per_mg_feces, y=Abundance_S24_7, color=Source))+ geom_point()+geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

## t.test for Abundance and Lcn2


t.test for OTU

t.test for Lcn2 and power

power calculation 

add one column (before VS after gavage - as factor (source)) 

t.test on after gavage
