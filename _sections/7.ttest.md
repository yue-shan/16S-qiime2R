## t.test
The function t.test(X~Y,mu=0, alt="two.sided", conf=0.95, var.eq=F, paired=F) performs Welch Two Sample t-test. mu = 0 means null hypothesis is that the two is equal. var.eq=F- not same number of sample. The above are the default setting. Can also use t.test(df$X, df$Y). 

```
attach(pd_agg_family)
t.test(Abundance~Treatment,mu=0, alt="two.sided", conf=0.95, var.eq=F, paired=F)
t.test(Abundance[TreatmentWeek=="IL10-SPF W0"], Abundance[TreatmentWeek=="IL10-SPF+BF W0"])

# Mann Whitney U / Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test comparing the median of each group
wilcox.test(Abundance~Treatment, mu=0, alt="two.sided", conf=0.95, paired=F, exact=F, correct=T, conf.inf=T)
```
To do t-test for every family and every week, first write a function and then sapply.
```
t.test_pvalue <- function (df, a="Abundance", f="Treatment") {
 l <- t.test(df[[a]]~df[[f]])
 return(l[["p.value"]])
}
Family_t <- ddply(pd_agg_family,.(pd_agg_family$Family, pd_agg_family$Source),t.test_pvalue,a="Abundance", f="Treatment")
Significant_Family<- Family_t %>% rename (pvalue=V1) %>% arrange(pvalue)%>% filter(pvalue<0.1)
write.csv(Significant_Family,"SignificantFamily.csv")
```
## Power calculation

The function *power.t.test* can calculate power or N or type1 error when you provide the SD of pooled group, the difference in the mean value, and two out of the three factors. For example, you can provide type I error and desired power, and it will calculate N number required in order to detect the difference between the mean. The larger the difference is, the smaller n you'll need to obtain enough power for the desired type 1 error. 

First, calculate mean for each group and SD for pooled data. Then calculate N number required - assuming type 1 error = 0.1 and power = 0.8. 

```
family_lcn2 %>% group_by(TreatmentWeek)%>% select(Lcn2_ug_per_mg_feces,TreatmentWeek)%>%filter(Lcn2_ug_per_mg_feces>0)%>%summarise_each(funs(mean,sd,length))

lcn2_pooled_sd <- family_lcn2 %>% group_by(Source)%>% select(Lcn2_ug_per_mg_feces,Source) %>% filter(Lcn2_ug_per_mg_feces>0) %>% summarise_each(funs(mean,sd,length))

for (i in 1:4) {lcn2_pooled_sd$power[i] <- (power.t.test(delta = lcn2_g$mean[i+4]-lcn2_g$mean[i], sd = lcn2_pooled_sd$sd[i], sig.level = 0.1,  power = 0.8, type = "two.sample", alternative = "two.sided")$n)}
lcn2_pooled_sd
```

## t.test for OTU

From the file of OTU_lcn2, we can split by OTU to generate a list. For each OTU, we can apply the t.test_pvalue function above. 
```
OTU_lcn2_gavage <- OTU_lcn2%>%filter(Source!=0)
list_OTU1 <- split(OTU_lcn2_gavage, OTU_lcn2_gavage$OTU, drop=F)
OTU_p<-as.data.frame(sapply(list_OTU1,t.test_pvalue))
OTU_p<-cbind(rownames(OTU_p),data.frame(OTU_p,row.names=NULL))
names(OTU_p)<-c("OTU","pvalue") #OTU_p contains the p-value of all OTUs
OTU_sig<- OTU_p%>%filter(pvalue<0.1)%>%arrange(pvalue)

## add one column (before VS after gavage - as factor (source)), calculate difference in t-test (both Lcn2 and key family/OTU)
