## Alpha-Diversity

Use *plot_richness* to make diversity plot:
```
  plot_richness(phylo, x = "Treatment",color = "Treatment",
                       measures=c("Observed","Shannon","Simpson"), nrow=1) +geom_boxplot()
```
The difference in the measurement methods: 

"Diversity indices applied to microbiota data consist of differing weights of two components, richness and evenness. Richness is a count of the number of different taxa observed in the community without regard to their frequencies, and evenness refers to the equitability of the taxa frequencies in a community. 
Three commonly used alpha diversity measures include species observed, Shannon index and Simpson index:
           S(obs)= ∑kI(pk>0)
           Shannon = −∑kpk ln(pk)
           Simpson=∑kp2k,
where p is some function of frequency, often relative abundance (proportion of total sequences) for each taxon, k.

Species observed is equal to richness and therefore provides no weight to the evenness component, Shannon index equally weights richness and evenness and Simpson index provides more weight to evenness." [Ref](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29872428/) 

Similarly, you can specify some graph requirements:

```
Shannon <-
  plot_richness(phylo, x = "Treatment",color = "Treatment",
                       measures=c("Shannon")) +geom_boxplot()+
  ggtitle("Shannon Diversity") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue", viridis::viridis(6)))+
  theme(axis.title.y = element_text(size=8,color="Black"),
      axis.title.x = element_blank(),
      axis.text.y = element_text(size=8,color="Black"),
      axis.text.x = element_text(size=8,color="Black"),
      axis.ticks = element_blank(),
      
      legend.title = element_blank(),
      legend.text = element_text(size = 8),
      legend.key.size = unit(0.5, "cm"),legend.key.height = unit(0.5, "cm"),
      legend.position="bottom",
      
      panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
      panel.grid.major = element_line(linetype = "solid",size=0.2,colour = "grey"),
      panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white", colour = "black", size=1.2),
      
      strip.text = element_blank())
